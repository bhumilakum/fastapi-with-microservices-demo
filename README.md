# Microservice in Python using FastAPI

## Introduction to Microservices
Microservice is the approach of breaking down large monolith application into individual applications specializing in a specific service/functionality. This approach is often known as Service-Oriented Architecture or SOA.

In monolithic architecture, every business logic resides in the same application. Application services such as user management, authentication, and other features use the same database.

## Why Microservice in Python
Python is a perfect tool for building micro-services because it comes with a great community, easy learning curve and tons of libraries. Due to the introduction of asynchronous programming in Python, web frameworks with performance on-par with GO and Node.js, has emerged.

## Introduction to FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, web framework, which comes with tons of cool features like auto-documentation based on OpenAPI and built-in serialization and validation library.

## Why FastAPI
Some of the reason why FastAPI is a great choice for building microservices in Python is:
- Auto documentation
- Async/Await support
- Built-in validation and serialization
- 100% type annotated so autocompletion works great
